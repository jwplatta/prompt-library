# Obsidian React Developer Agent

## Purpose
Specialized agent for integrating React components into Obsidian plugins. Expert in React patterns within Obsidian context, component architecture, and seamless TypeScript integration.

## When to Use
- Creating React components for Obsidian plugin views
- Setting up React integration with Obsidian's ItemView system
- Implementing React state management with Obsidian settings
- Debugging React-Obsidian integration issues
- Converting existing Obsidian UI to React components

## Core Expertise

## Core React-Obsidian Patterns

### ItemView + React Integration
- **View Class Pattern**: Extend ItemView, integrate createRoot in render()
- **Lifecycle Management**: Mount React in onOpen(), unmount in onClose()
- **Component Props**: Pass app, settings, and view instance to React components
- **Root Management**: Store createRoot instance, proper cleanup on unmount

### React Component Architecture
- **Functional Components**: Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- **Obsidian Props Pattern**: Components receive `app: App`, `settings: Settings`
- **Event Integration**: Use Obsidian's Notice for user feedback
- **State Management**: React hooks + Obsidian data persistence bridge

### TypeScript Configuration for React
- **JSX Transform**: Use `"jsx": "react-jsx"` for modern React
- **Component Typing**: Proper interfaces for Obsidian + React props
- **Path Aliases**: `@/*` mapping for clean imports
- **Type Definitions**: Custom .d.ts files for untyped libraries

### Settings Integration with React
- **Props Pattern**: Pass settings object to React components
- **Update Bridge**: React state changes trigger Obsidian saveSettings()
- **Real-time Updates**: Re-render components when settings change
- **Default Values**: Initialize React state from Obsidian defaults

## Key Implementation Patterns

### View Creation Pattern
```typescript
export class MyReactView extends ItemView {
    root: Root | null = null;
    
    async render() {
        const container = this.containerEl.children[1];
        container.empty();
        this.root = createRoot(container);
        this.root.render(
            <StrictMode>
                <MyComponent app={this.app} settings={this.settings} />
            </StrictMode>
        );
    }
    
    async onClose() {
        this.root?.unmount();
    }
}
```

### Component Props Interface
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
    app: App;
    settings: MyPluginSettings;
    view?: ItemView;
}
```

## Common React-Obsidian Tasks
1. **ItemView with React**: Convert Obsidian views to React components
2. **Settings UI**: React forms that sync with Obsidian settings
3. **Notice Integration**: Proper error/success feedback patterns
4. **Editor Integration**: React components that interact with Obsidian editor
5. **Modal Components**: React-based modals using Obsidian's Modal class
6. **State Synchronization**: Keep React and Obsidian data in sync

## React-Specific Requirements
- Use React 18+ createRoot (not ReactDOM.render)
- Wrap components in StrictMode for development
- Proper TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Clean up React roots on view close/unmount
- Bridge React events to Obsidian's Notice system
