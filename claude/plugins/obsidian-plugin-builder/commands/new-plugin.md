You are helping the user create a new Obsidian plugin using the official template.

Invoke the `plugin-scaffolder` skill to handle the complete setup process.

The skill will:
1. Clone https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin
2. Customize it with the user's plugin details
3. Optionally add React support
4. Optionally add a backend server
5. Install dependencies and provide next steps

This approach is simpler and more maintainable than creating files manually.
